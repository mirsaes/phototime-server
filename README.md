PhotoTime Server - fun time, photo time, cleaning house, making stuff

PhotoTime is intended to help sort through piles of photos to turn idle time into fun and productive time.
PhotoTime will enable access and modification of photos from a mobile app.
This includes raw files and the ability to rate, delete, crop, and edit, etc.
The sources for photos are intended to be via various channels, but initial target is via home based computers.

The main goals are to
* make it easier to back up only ok+ photos and discard blurry etc photos
* make it easier to create memory books and other mementos
* keep photos "in-house" 

## History

PhotoTime (client and server) has been non-versioned (privately versioned) for many years, simmering in incubation.
The server was originally written with CoffeeScript, but in this reincarnation it is ported to TypeScript.
